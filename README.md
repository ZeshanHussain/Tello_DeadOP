# Tello_DeadOP
The DJI Tello Drone is a lightweight quadcopter designed for Developers. Many open-source projects on platforms like GitHub, offering valuable resources such as libraries and tutorials. This support has made Tello popular in education, allowing students to explore programming, robotics, and computer vision through hands-on experiences. The project demonstrates a sophisticated Graphical User Interface (GUI) crafted using Qt Creator and powered by C++. Leveraging the capabilities of the DJI Tello API libraries, the GUI seamlessly integrates advanced features. Through C++ programming, the GUI incorporates an AI-driven video streaming module, ensuring real-time and high-quality video feed from the drone. The interface provides an intuitive display of the drone's connection status, enabling users to monitor the drone's connectivity effortlessly. Additionally, precise flight controls are implemented, allowing users to manage the drone's movements with accuracy and ease. The GUI also incorporates geolocation services, displaying the user's location, and fetches current date and weather information, enriching the user experience. Moreover, the GUI retrieves and showcases the drone's battery percentage, ensuring users are well-informed about the drone's power status. This project highlights the seamless integration of C++ programming with DJI Tello API libraries, resulting in a sophisticated and feature-rich GUI for controlling the drone effectively.
